Encaptulation:
===============================================================================
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit.

Advantage of Encapsulation in Java:

.. code:: JAVA

      *By providing only a setter or getter method, you can make the class read-only or write-only. In other words, you can skip the getter or setter methods.
      *It provides you the control over the data. Suppose you want to set the value of id which should be greater than 100 only, you can write the logic inside         the setter method. You can write the logic not to store the negative numbers in the setter methods.
      *It is a way to achieve data hiding in Java because other class will not be able to access the data through the private data members.
 

Java Package:
===============================================================================

A java package is a group of similar types of classes, interfaces and sub-packages. |

Package in java can be categorized in two form, built-in package and user-defined package. |

There are many built-in packages such as java, lang, awt, javax, swing, net, io, util, sql etc. |

Advantage of Java Package. |
1) Java package is used to categorize the classes and interfaces so that they can be easily maintained. |

2) Java package provides access protection. |

3) Java package removes naming collision.
